<em>It was finally happening after the long and rough days Ali’s father-Akbar was coming out from prison. Ali who was only five years old when he saw his father last time, now he is a married man who has a daughter named Fathima. Ali hugged his father and guides him to his car. Mohan who is Akbar’s close friend and neighbor was also waiting in Ali’s car.
They entered the car. “Even after twenty-five years, you are still the same my friend” Mohan said in a friendly voice. “You know what happened really that day, where it all changed” Akbar replied and said “Ali was only a small boy, how would we make in stand there in the court as witness, nobody could have believed us”. They reached at their town. Everybody was looking at their car as a criminal was in it.
Fake stories has already been pinned in their minds, even children were there. As they got out of their car howling, teasing and cursing were heard. They were at Mohan’s house. Mohan’s wife was setting the table for lunch. Akbar’s house was on loan and was sealed by the bank. The only true witness left was Ali who doesn’t remember what happened. How could a boy of ‘five’ remember things after ‘twenty five’ years has passed. ”papa, you should come and visit Fathima”. Ali asked in an exciting voice.”I will, but not now. I have some work to do in here. Then I will come to your city to see your family”.
Days passed by. The only persons who knows the real truth was Mohan, Ali and Mohan’s wife. They were trying hard to prove that Akbar didn’t murder his wife but was someone else. They tried to re-open the case again but nothing seems to work. They didn’t have any evidence left except Ali who was a kid at that time. Everything was against them. 
“We need to find Jafar” Mohan said and continued “he is the last evidence to prove this case”. Akbar got angry when he heard his name and said “he was one of my close friend and yet he betrayed me for some money, how could he…”. “I was also surprised at the court room; he just changed his statement at the last moment”. Mohan replied. “I have heard some rumors that Jafar has left this town and have settled down in the cities, he never came back they said”. “We will find him no matter wherever he is hiding from us” Mohan said in a deep voice.
It’s was an evening. Mohan and Akbar were chatting in the hall. “Thief….thief….” it was a loud scream. “Isn’t that your wife’s voice”. “Come on”. They rushed to the kitchen. “What happened, Saritha?”.“There was a thief looking at me from that window”. “There is no one here dear; you must have seen a reflection or something else” “no, Mohan I saw a thief there”. Suddenly after that a ringing was heard”. Akbar got up at once and picked up the phone. It was an unknown number. The stranger from the other side of the phone said “hey I know who you are and also that you didn’t have committed any crime. But that’s over now, if you are trying to reopen that case again, then the next scream will be her last scream. I hope you still remember your wife’s last scream”. Before Akbar could say anything, he cut the phone.   </em>
