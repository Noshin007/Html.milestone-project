        <h2><u>My Personal Experience/Review</u></h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">COET or College Of engineering Thalaserry is one of the best colleges in Malabar region of Kerala.My College is loacted on a hill called kundoormala , as the name suggest it,s hill about ...........
                The college is always cool and windy as sea breeze takes us away from the hiiltop.Our college about almost some gppd acres offers places to explore through the nature or we call it the forest of coet.
                My college also has several gardens here and there full of Flowers and fragrance.We also have a Photo Frame wwhich looks over the Arabian sea . Our canteen provides some decent ,tasty food and from our canteenwe can see 
                our ground ,my favorite place in the college . Coet is one of best colleges i have ever seen which promotyes sports , Our ground has a Cricket ground , Cricket nets, Football posts, Volley ball court and kho kho post.Other than that we have a badminton court in the college compound.
                COET actively participates in all events under KTU both indoor and outdoor. There is no COET without taliking about its Arts, Coet is full of programs and fun.Every type of programs or special days is celebrated at coet without any discrimination.Our college also provides decent placements too.Our Union , Seniors and facualties makes the college even more beautiful . I believe COET is one of the only Anti Free Ragging College in Malabar or Even kerala itself.Me personally have not experienced even a single raggimg or even heard about it from anyone, i believe in this 
                time where there is no peace in other college it is a big thing.We have some of ythe best faculties to teach us . Our claases eqiuped with smart board and projectors helps in better and more technical learning.
                The infrastructure of the college if not the best is still good and beautiful.</p>
